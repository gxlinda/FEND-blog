                    <p>Strange... All humans stayed home last week. Even the Dad-Human, who usually leaves to work early, and arrives only late afternoon. Woof, what happened with them? Actually I love this situation, as I get more hugs and cuddlings, and
                        more MEAT too. They mention something about "corona", but I do not understand what that is.

                    <p>I'm soooooooo happy! I waited a whole month at the shelter for this moment! My caretakers told me, that someone will come, and my life will change, but I still can't believe it really happened! A Mum-Human and a Daughter-Human came
                        just because of me, and they adopted me at once! Can you believe that?</p>

                    <p>I felt so bad... It was cold, I was hungry, and nobody took care of me. Humans did not want to help me, as I had no fur due to a bacterial infection. But all of a sudden that Lady-Human came to me, put a towel around me, and took me
                        with her. I was brought to an animal rescue shelter, where everyone was so nice to me. But the best part was, that I got food to eat, and I was not hungry anymore.
