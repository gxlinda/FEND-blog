                    <p>Strange... All humans stayed home last week. Even the Dad-Human, who usually leaves to work early, and arrives only late afternoon. Woof, <strong>what happened to them</strong>? Actually I love this situation, as I get more hugs and
                        cuddlings, and more MEAT too. They mention something about <i>corona</i>, but I do not understand what that is.
                    </p>
                    <p>If corona means that my loved ones are around me, and we take care of each other, and play much much much more together, than I simply love that corona! We even make much longer walks than before in the near forest. As a wise dog ones

                        <u>The only thing I miss is the dog-school.</u> There was only one session, and after that it was forbidden to go, due to that corona-thing. I miss my dog-friends, we could play so well together...</p>
