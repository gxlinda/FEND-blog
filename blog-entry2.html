                    <p>I'm soooooooo happy! I waited a whole month at the shelter for this moment! My caretakers told me, that someone will come, and my life will change, but I still can't believe it really happened! A Mum-Human and a Daughter-Human came
                        just because of me, and they adopted me at once! Can you believe that?
                    </p>
                    <p>When we arrived home, I was introduced to 4 other animals. My Human already shared her home with two other dogs, and two cats. To tell you the truth, I have never met a cat before... But they are interesting, if I bark on them and
                        try to invite them to play, they run away. Very funny!
                    </p>
                    <p>We also made a visit to the vet. I received some vitamins and other stuff. At home I had a warm bath, which I enjoyed. But the best, is that <strong>I finally have my own Human</strong>! It seems she loves me, as she gave me kisses,
                        pet me all the time and gave me yummy food. I love to be here!</p>
