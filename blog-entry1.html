                    <p>I felt so bad... It was cold, I was hungry, and nobody took care of me. Humans did not want to help me, as I had no fur due to a bacterial or fungus infection. But all of a sudden that Lady-Human came to me, put a towel around me,
                        and took me with her. I was brought to an animal rescue shelter, where everyone was so nice to me. But the best part was, that I got food to eat, and I was not hungry anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were many nice people at the shelter, who tried to help me. Every day my whole body was treated with a special cream, so very slowly, but my fur started to grow again. Itching also started to fade away.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were lots of other puppies at the shelter, but I was never allowed to play with them, as my caretakers was afraid of spreading my infection onto them. So I was put in a separate cage, which was very boring. And as it was autumn,
                        and I had just a very small fur, I was always cold. Although I have received a little knitted coat, I had to move and jump and bark and climb to keep me warm.</p>
